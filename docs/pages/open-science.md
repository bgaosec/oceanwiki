# Open Science

## Publishing Non-Papers

[Zenodo](https://github.com/zenodo/zenodo), developed and managed by CERN, and [figshare](https://figshare.com/) by Springer Nature are two free ways to publish more than your results, especially your code. Introductions are for example given in
* [Referencing and citing GitHub content with Zenodo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content) 
* [How to fine tune the DOI record on Zenodo](https://github.com/castelao/inception)
* [Best practice for managing your outputs on Figshare](https://help.figshare.com/article/best-practice-for-managing-your-outputs-on-figshare)
Another possibility to publish outside journals would be [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) (but of which I (OceanOle (talk)) know almost nothing about).
For publishing raw data, especially figshare and [pangaea](https://www.pangaea.de/), a Data Publisher for Earth & Environmental Science, are well-suited services.

* [Create badges](https://shields.io/badges) to be used in GitHub/GitLab README to for example reference the accompanying publication. See [use case here](https://github.com/opinner/Pinner_et_al_2024).
