## PhD regulations for TRR institutions

Regarding the timelines mentioned on the websites below: Please note that the timelines can be significantly shortened if the chair is well organised and the reviewers are fast. So make sure to talk about the timeline with your supervisors well in advance and discuss if and how you can shorten the timeline if necessary.

### Universität Hamburg

Department of **Earth System Sciences**:

* To get an idea of the timeline, check the “Timing on the finish line” section on this page: https://www.geo.uni-hamburg.de/en/studium/promotion.html.      
* Please note that you’ll have to “apply” to formally open the doctorate proceedings and this application has to be approved by the “Fachpromotionsausschuss” (FPA), which only meets seven times a year. Here are the dates, including the deadlines by which you have to submit your request to open the proceedings: https://www.geo.uni-hamburg.de/en/studium/promotion/nachrichten/proma.html. Without the FPA’s approval you can’t defend your PhD.

Department of **Mathematics**:

* In the section “Submission of the dissertation / Application to open the doctorate proceedings” you’ll find the instructions for submitting: https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/en/studium/promohabil/promotion.html. 
* According to their website, the time between the submission of the dissertation and the disputation is approx. 3 months.
