**And online course recommendations from an expert in ML and Atmospheric science (Stephan Rasp, below):**
*Next, here are some ML resources. Of course, it depends on how much time you want to spend on this. To build a basic ML model, you don’t need much to start with. As I mentioned a RandomForest is always a good start (I am currently comparing RFs vs NNs and am finding that RFs in a many ways can be better). The Python library to use here is scikit-learn. The great thing about sklearn is that every ML model has the exact same API, so it’s really easy to use. Here is a quick introduction: https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-scikit-learn-a-python-machine-learning-library/

If you want to invest more time and feel intrigued by deep learning (as I did during my PhD), there are essentially two great options.

*The first is https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/. This is a really well structured course that progressively goes through current DL techniques. Solid choice.

*The one I took is https://course.fast.ai/. But I took the first version of the course, which is now in its third version and it changed quite a lot. This course uses its own library, and is very code centered. They also use their own Python library, which is tailored towards image and text problems. This makes it kind of hard to apply these things to geo scientific problems.

*Here is the one I would recommend if you have some time to spare: http://course18.fast.ai/ml This course is offered from the same people as the fast.ai course above but in this course the focus is on ML basics instead of the latest deep learning. In the ML course, you will start with good ML practices, random forests and eventually neural network. I would definitely recommend checking it out to see if you like the teaching style.
