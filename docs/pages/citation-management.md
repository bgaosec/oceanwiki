# Citation Management

Part of science is being aware of and referencing previous work, aka the “state of the art”. To keep the unlimited numbers of paper organized, citation management is necessary. The most popular choices are [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/search/), Citavi and [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/). 

## [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)

Free and open source tool to manage references; supports a browser plugin to import new references.
An example for how to set up Zotero for Latex is described in the blog post [Publication Management with Zotero](https://gunnarvoet.github.io/post/zotero/) by Oceanographer Gunnar Voet
Useful plugins are:
*[better-bibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/) Better citation keys for exports to BibTeX
*[ZotFile](http://zotfile.com/) Better management of attachments, e.g. PDFs
If you work with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), you can directly connect a project to your Zotero account to avoid manually uploading a *.bib* file. Additionally, Zotero supports -compatible citations.

### 

Before submitting a paper, you may want to trim your all-encompassing .bib file to just the entries you actually cited. You achieve this with Zotero
