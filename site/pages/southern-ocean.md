__TOC__ 

**This is a template for a page. Have a look at the source code, delete the following explanation and add your own text:**

<nowiki></nowiki> â€” when this template link is used, it will be replaced once and for all with the content of Template:Name as of the time the page with the link is saved: a copy of the contents of Template:Name will be substituted for the template link. The contents are then a part of the including page, and can be edited normally, separately from the original. Note: later changes to the source template page will not be propagated to the page with the template link. Therefore <nowiki></nowiki> will insert this page after saving. After this, you can edit it to your liking

The command <nowiki>__TOC__</nowiki> inserts the table of content, if you want it before the wiki inserts one automatically, if you have more than 3 sections. 

Despite it being cumbersome, please add references to your pages, like this or this . They get automatically appended to the end of the page.

Or just mention the most important literature to you in its own section.

You can tag a page like this <nowiki>Category:Ocean</nowiki> to automatically add it to that category.
